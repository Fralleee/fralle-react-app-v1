# Live demo 

Changes are automatically rendered as you type.

* Implements [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/)
* Renders actual, "native" React DOM elements
* Allows you to escape or skip HTML (try toggling the checkboxes above)
* If you escape or skip the HTML, no \`dangerouslySetInnerHTML\` is used! Yay!

## HTML block below

  Little did I know that I would be seeing him naked multiple times later on.

## How about some code?
```js
var React = require('react');
var Markdown = require('react-markdown');

React.render(
  <Markdown source="# Your markdown here" />,
  document.getElementById('content')
);
```

Testing this was not as easy as one would have thought. I got really hammered and just decided to knock one out.

Luckily I was not alone. Many of my friends showed up and helped out.

  ...but I rarely got time to get hammered and knock one out.

```cs
public class Bengtsson 
{
  public int Larsson { get; set; }
  Start() 
  {
    Math.Random(Larsson, 10);
    Debug.Log("Tested");
  }
}
```
